     * Another good practice is to have a “solution” tsconfig.json file that simply has references
     * to all of your leaf-node projects and sets files to an empty array (otherwise the solution
     * file will cause double compilation of files). This will prevent an incorrect invocation of
     * tsc without -b from trying to build the entire packages folder source files as one compilation
     * (which will fail, but drop a bunch of .js files in random places as an annoying side effect).
